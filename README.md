Please refer to the `src` folder for your consideration. Within, you will find:
* task.ipynb
* schema.py
* detect.py

The `task.ipynb` documents the process of exploratory data analysis (EDA), but also serves as the primary presentation of my thought process.
The functions created in `schema.py` and `detect.py` are simply streamlined versions of what was implmented in `task.ipynb`.

The workflow is very much inspired by Claudio Jolowicz's [Hypermodern Python](https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/) project, which I have evangelized to my current workplace in 2021. 

The ETL process is currently based on the [pandera](https://pandera.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) python package.
